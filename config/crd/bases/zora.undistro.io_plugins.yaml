                          HostProcess determines if a container should be run as a 'Host Process' container.
                          All of a Pod's containers must have the same effective HostProcess value
                          (it is not allowed to have a mix of HostProcess containers and non-HostProcess containers).
                          In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.
